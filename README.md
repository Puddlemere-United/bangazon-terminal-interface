# Bangazon

## The Command Line Ordering System - a test driven application!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

``` Ruby ``` for installation guide, see [the official Ruby download page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system


## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Requirements

You will create a series of prompts that will allow the user to create various types of data in your ordering system.

1. Start with writing unit tests. As a group, determine the core functionality of the application. Define classes and methods that you think you need to build. Do that before writing the implementation code for core logic. DO NOT WRITE TESTS FOR THE USER INTERFACE (menu and prompts).
1. All classes and methods must be fully documented.
